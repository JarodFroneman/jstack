# Security Policy

## Supported Version

Security fixes are applied to the latest release on the default branch.

## Reporting

Do not open a public issue containing a credential, exploit payload, or private
repository detail. Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting for this
repository. Revoke any exposed credential before reporting it.

Include the affected version, operating system, reproduction, impact, and any
suggested mitigation. Reports are acknowledged after they are reviewed; no
response-time guarantee is offered.

## Trust Boundary

JStack is a local workflow and evidence tool. Its QA runner executes reviewed
repository commands with a scrubbed environment and isolated home, but standard
Python cannot remove the current user's filesystem or network privileges. Use a
host/container sandbox for untrusted repositories.

Evidence receipts protect against accidental or MCP-caller alteration inside
one server session. They do not protect against compromise of the same operating
system account.
